FPL Price Change Prediction Project
Introduction
Fantasy Premier League (FPL) is a massively popular online game that follows the well-known English Premier League soccer competition. 
Millions of players worldwide engage in building and managing their fantasy teams, competing based on the real-life performances of professional footballers.

One interesting aspect of FPL is the fluctuation of player prices. These price changes occur due to various factors, such as the number of transfers in and out, the rate at which players are being transferred, and other undisclosed algorithms. 

Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to develop a price change prediction model for FPL players using Python, Flask, SQL, and Machine Learning techniques (maybe learn some AI too?). Initially, this project began as an exercise to play around with the official FPL APIs while learning Python. 
Recognizing that very few websites attempt to predict player price changesâ€”and that the exact calculation methods are not publicly known, I set out to create my own predictive model. I still plan to play around with overall looks and interface of the player stats as well.

Currently, the project involves daily data collection that feeds into a SQL database. This data will be analyzed to determine patterns and factors influencing price changes, 
ultimately contributing to a machine learning model capable of predicting future price fluctuations.
